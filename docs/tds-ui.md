# Tedious UI

Tedious UI is a set of maintained, reusable, extendable components to help you get started with your next project.

It consists of base patterns, components, containers, helpers, language strings, assets and store actions, middlewares and reducers.

Together these elements gives you the power to put together beautiful and complex views. All components use flow types to specify their expected props and to describe how they can be used to achive the expected behaviour.
